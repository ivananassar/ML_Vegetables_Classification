# ML_Vegetables_Classification
Classification using Traditional and Deep Learning

Using a Dataset of Fruits and Vegetables.
They are 21 classes pf Fruits and Vegetables in total and a dataset of 3631 images (which was not enough for 21 variables).
We use the logistic regression as a method for tranditional machine learning and tuning it with GridSearch.
For the Deep Learning we used 7 layers for the model and a batch size of 32 and epochs of 15 but still was not performant due to the lack of data. 60% approximately was what we got and a 45% for the first method.
